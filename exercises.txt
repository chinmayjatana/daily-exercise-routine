- Exercises marked with "- x" are advanced variations
- "Weight plate" in jumping jacks can be substituted with any household item (book, water bottle, etc.)
- Feel free to swap exercises within the same muscle group category if needed
- 10 sessions provide variety and ensure all exercises are utilized

- Core standing exercises rotate with different mat exercises
- Full body movements (burpees, inchworm) are spaced out
- Upper body exercises are paired when possible for efficiency
