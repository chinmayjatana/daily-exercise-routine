NOTES:
- All exercises require only a mat (no additional equipment needed)
- Sessions are designed to avoid muscle overlap between consecutive days
- Each session has 2 standing exercises + 2 mat exercises (4 total)
- "Weight plate" in jumping jacks can be substituted with any household item (book, water bottle, etc.)
- Feel free to swap exercises within the same muscle group category if needed
- 10 sessions provide variety and ensure all exercises are utilized

- Upper body exercises are distributed across sessions
- Core stability exercises provide variety in muscle engagement
