NOTES:
- All exercises require only a mat (no additional equipment needed)
- Sessions are designed to avoid targeting the same muscle groups consecutively
- Each session balances standing (cardio/legs/core) with mat work (different ab regions)
- Exercises marked with "- x" might need modifications or are advanced variations
- Feel free to swap exercises within the same muscle group category if needed
- New sessions 6-8 provide additional variety and target previously under-represented areas
- Include flexibility/cool-down exercises to prevent injury and improve recovery
- "Weight plate" in jumping jacks can be substituted with any household item (book, water bottle, etc.)
